I built: scripts, dashboards, checkers, reports, pipelines, templates, and small internal tools.\n\nHow I\u2019m using it so far:\n\n* **Processes &amp; SOP systems** (standard work, checklists, enforcement via scripts)\n* **Automations** (glue work between tools, recurring workflows)\n* **Analysis &amp; reporting** (CSV/Sheets exports, summaries, charts, narrative)\n* **Forecasts/projections** (capacity, cost, staffing scenarios)\n* **Project-specific tools** (small CLIs and utilities that make teams faster)\n\nThe leverage is in both directions:\n\n* **Horizontal** (finance, ops, marketing, whatever needs structure &amp; repetition)\n* **Vertical** (it can act like an associate, forecaster, analyst, live-ops manager, depending on how you frame the task and what data you feed it)\n\nIf you want to go full sci-fi, I can even imagine it reducing *my* role long-term. \n\n**Question:** What are people using Claude Code for that\u2019s *not* the obvious \u201cbuild an app /write code/refactor\u201d?  \n  \nI\u2019m especially interested in **non-obvious ops workflows**, internal tools, governance systems, and anything that reliably saves real hours every week.

    "content": "Hi guys,\n\nBeen using Ultra for maybe 4-5 months now, this is my usage which I max every month and usually go over a little with set costs. \n\nMainly using Claude 4.5 Opus just due to accuracy, plus larger code base. \n\nI do use Anti Gravity a little on Pro but it's not quite as good just due to the context that Cursor seems to understand the codebase better. But that gets me through with some Opus. \n\nI'm enjoying Gemini Flash alot as well especially on cost side.\n\nBut not sure if it's worth it to go to Claude Code or anyone else going to work out cheaper? Anti gravity seems to be very good value right now but there just about to change the pro plan with weekly limits, I could invest more time to get context better. \n\nAnyone have any recommendations?",

I've been using Cursor here and there for a while and have been a paid customer since Oct 2024 ($20 plan).\n\nMy Nov invoice was on Nov 20. I started working on my own project in early Dec, so plenty of time until the next invoice (Dec 20), right? Well, ever since I started my project, my spending has gone through the roof.\n\nSee the timeline below:\n\n \\- Nov 20: regular $20 invoice, life's good\n\n \\- Dec 1: started working on my project\n\n \\- Dec 14: consumed all the limits, paid $20.04 more\n\n \\- Dec 18: consumed all the limits, paid $40 more\n\n \\- Dec 20: (repeats), paid $20 more\n\n \\- Dec 23: paid $33.03 more\n\n \\- Dec 24: paid $61.09 more\n\n \\- Dec 26: paid $32.31 (switched to Pro+)\n\n \\- Dec 30: paid $81.07 more\n\n \\- Jan 03: paid $101.40 more\n\nMy current on-demand usage is $300 out of a $400 limit (kept raising the limits).\n\nSo, what the actual fk? Yes, I mostly use Opus because other models produce garbage. From time to time, I use Composer just to get some quick fixes done, but Opus is still doing all the heavy lifting.\n\nI tried Claude Code before, but I kept having the feeling that I was losing a mental connection with my code after several sessions, so I switched back to Cursor. I'm not vibe coding. \n\nAny suggestions on how to minimize spending?",

    "content": "I usually post on Linkedin but people mentioned there's a big community of devs who might benefit from this here so I decided to make a post just in case it helps you guys. Happy to answer any questions/ would love to hear feedback. Sorry if it reads markety, it's copied from the Linkedin post I made where you don't get much post attention if you don't write this way:\n\nStrawberry launches today it's Free. Open source. Guaranteed by information theory.  \n  \nThe insight: When Claude confidently misreads your stack trace and proposes the wrong root cause it's not broken. It's doing exactly what it was trained to do: compress the internet into weights, decompress on demand. When there isn't enough information to reconstruct the right answer, it fills gaps with statistically plausible but wrong content.  \n  \nThe breakthrough: We proved hallucinations occur when information budgets fall below mathematical thresholds. We can calculate exactly how many bits of evidence are needed to justify any claim, before generation happens.  \nNow it's a Claude Code MCP. One tool call: detect\\_hallucination  \n  \nWhy this is a game-changer?  \n  \nInstead of debugging Claude's mistakes for 3 hours, you catch them in 30 seconds. Instead of \"looks right to me,\" you get mathematical confidence scores. Instead of shipping vibes, you ship verified reasoning. Claude doesn't just flag its own BS, it self-corrects, runs experiments, gathers more real evidence, and only proceeds with what survives. Vibe coding with guardrails.  \n  \nReal example:  \n  \nClaude root-caused why a detector I built had low accuracy. Claude made 6 confident claims that could have led me down the wrong path for hours. I said: \"Run detect\\_hallucination on your root cause reasoning, and enrich your analysis if any claims don't verify.\"  \n  \nResults:  \nClaim 1: \u2705 Verified (99.7% confidence)  \nClaim 4: \u274c Flagged (0.3%) \u2014 \"My interpretation, not proven\"  \nClaim 5: \u274c Flagged (20%) \u2014 \"Correlation \u2260 causation\"  \nClaim 6: \u274c Flagged (0.8%) \u2014 \"Prescriptive, not factual\"  \nClaude's response: \"I cannot state interpretive conclusions as those did not pass verification.\"  \n  \nRe-analyzed. Ran causal experiments. Only stated verified facts. The updated root cause fixed my detector and the whole process finished in under 5 minutes.  \n  \nWhat it catches:  \n  \nPhantom citations, confabulated docs, evidence-independent answers  \nStack trace misreads, config errors, negation blindness, lying comments  \nCorrelation stated as causation, interpretive leaps, unverified causal chains  \nDocker port confusion, stale lock files, version misattribution  \n  \nThe era of \"trust me bro\" vibe coding is ending.  \nGitHub: [https://github.com/leochlon/pythea/tree/main/strawberry](https://github.com/leochlon/pythea/tree/main/strawberry)  \nBase Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11208](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11208)  \n(New supporting pre-print on procedural hallucinations drops next week.)\n\nMIT license. 2 minutes to install.
