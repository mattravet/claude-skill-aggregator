    "content": "I\u2019m an ops person. I\u2019ve done the whole range: hyperscaling startups, big corporates, execution roles, Head/Director-level responsibility.\n\nClaude Code is the first \u201ccoding AI\u201d that feels like **headcount compression** for ops work. I built: scripts, dashboards, checkers, reports, pipelines, templates, and small internal tools.\n\nHow I\u2019m using it so far:\n\n* **Processes &amp; SOP systems** (standard work, checklists, enforcement via scripts)\n* **Automations** (glue work between tools, recurring workflows)\n* **Analysis &amp; reporting** (CSV/Sheets exports, summaries, charts, narrative)\n* **Forecasts/projections** (capacity, cost, staffing scenarios)\n* **Project-specific tools** (small CLIs and utilities that make teams faster)\n\nThe leverage is in both directions:\n\n* **Horizontal** (finance, ops, marketing, whatever needs structure &amp; repetition)\n* **Vertical** (it can act like an associate, forecaster, analyst, live-ops manager, depending on how you frame the task and what data you feed it)\n\nIf you want to go full sci-fi, I can even imagine it reducing *my* role long-term. \n\n**Question:** What are people using Claude Code for that\u2019s *not* the obvious \u201cbuild an app /write code/refactor\u201d?  \n  \nI\u2019m especially interested in **non-obvious ops workflows**, internal tools, governance systems, and anything that reliably saves real hours every week. Can be personal or job related!",

    "content": "Hi guys,\n\nBeen using Ultra for maybe 4-5 months now, this is my usage which I max every month and usually go over a little with set costs. \n\nMainly using Claude 4.5 Opus just due to accuracy, plus larger code base. \n\nI do use Anti Gravity a little on Pro but it's not quite as good just due to the context that Cursor seems to understand the codebase better. But that gets me through with some Opus. \n\nI'm enjoying Gemini Flash alot as well especially on cost side.\n\nBut not sure if it's worth it to go to Claude Code or anyone else going to work out cheaper? Anti gravity seems to be very good value right now but there just about to change the pro plan with weekly limits, I could invest more time to get context better. \n\nAnyone have any recommendations?",

    "content": "I'm a pretty experienced engineer (15+ YOE). I've been using Cursor here and there for a while and have been a paid customer since Oct 2024 ($20 plan).\n\nMy Nov invoice was on Nov 20. I started working on my own project in early Dec, so plenty of time until the next invoice (Dec 20), right? Well, ever since I started my project, my spending has gone through the roof.\n\nSee the timeline below:\n\n \\- Nov 20: regular $20 invoice, life's good\n\n \\- Dec 1: started working on my project\n\n \\- Dec 14: consumed all the limits, paid $20.04 more\n\n \\- Dec 18: consumed all the limits, paid $40 more\n\n \\- Dec 20: (repeats), paid $20 more\n\n \\- Dec 23: paid $33.03 more\n\n \\- Dec 24: paid $61.09 more\n\n \\- Dec 26: paid $32.31 (switched to Pro+)\n\n \\- Dec 30: paid $81.07 more\n\n \\- Jan 03: paid $101.40 more\n\nMy current on-demand usage is $300 out of a $400 limit (kept raising the limits).\n\nSo, what the actual fk? Yes, I mostly use Opus because other models produce garbage. From time to time, I use Composer just to get some quick fixes done, but Opus is still doing all the heavy lifting.\n\nI tried Claude Code before, but I kept having the feeling that I was losing a mental connection with my code after several sessions, so I switched back to Cursor. I'm not vibe coding. \n\nAny suggestions on how to minimize spending?",
