I built: scripts, dashboards, checkers, reports, pipelines, templates, and small internal tools.\n\nHow I\u2019m using it so far:\n\n* **Processes &amp; SOP systems** (standard work, checklists, enforcement via scripts)\n* **Automations** (glue work between tools, recurring workflows)\n* **Analysis &amp; reporting** (CSV/Sheets exports, summaries, charts, narrative)\n* **Forecasts/projections** (capacity, cost, staffing scenarios)\n* **Project-specific tools** (small CLIs and utilities that make teams faster)\n\nThe leverage is in both directions:\n\n* **Horizontal** (finance, ops, marketing, whatever needs structure &amp; repetition)\n* **Vertical** (it can act like an associate, forecaster, analyst, live-ops manager, depending on how you frame the task and what data you feed it)\n\nIf you want to go full sci-fi, I can even imagine it reducing *my* role long-term. \n\n**Question:** What are people using Claude Code for that\u2019s *not* the obvious \u201cbuild an app /write code/refactor\u201d?  \n  \nI\u2019m especially interested in **non-obvious ops workflows**, internal tools, governance systems, and anything that reliably saves real hours every week.

But that gets me through with some Opus. \n\nI'm enjoying Gemini Flash alot as well especially on cost side.\n\nBut not sure if it's worth it to go to Claude Code or anyone else going to work out cheaper? Anti gravity seems to be very good value right now but there just about to change the pro plan with weekly limits, I could invest more time to get context better. \n\nAnyone have any recommendations?",

I've been using Cursor here and there for a while and have been a paid customer since Oct 2024 ($20 plan).\n\nMy Nov invoice was on Nov 20. I started working on my own project in early Dec, so plenty of time until the next invoice (Dec 20), right? Well, ever since I started my project, my spending has gone through the roof.\n\nSee the timeline below:\n\n \\- Nov 20: regular $20 invoice, life's good\n\n \\- Dec 1: started working on my project\n\n \\- Dec 14: consumed all the limits, paid $20.04 more\n\n \\- Dec 18: consumed all the limits, paid $40 more\n\n \\- Dec 20: (repeats), paid $20 more\n\n \\- Dec 23: paid $33.03 more\n\n \\- Dec 24: paid $61.09 more\n\n \\- Dec 26: paid $32.31 (switched to Pro+)\n\n \\- Dec 30: paid $81.07 more\n\n \\- Jan 03: paid $101.40 more\n\nMy current on-demand usage is $300 out of a $400 limit (kept raising the limits).\n\nSo, what the actual fk? Yes, I mostly use Opus because other models produce garbage. From time to time, I use Composer just to get some quick fixes done, but Opus is still doing all the heavy lifting.\n\nI tried Claude Code before, but I kept having the feeling that I was losing a mental connection with my code after several sessions, so I switched back to Cursor. I'm not vibe coding. \n\nAny suggestions on how to minimize spending?",

    "content": "I usually post on Linkedin but people mentioned there's a big community of devs who might benefit from this here so I decided to make a post just in case it helps you guys. Happy to answer any questions/ would love to hear feedback. Sorry if it reads markety, it's copied from the Linkedin post I made where you don't get much post attention if you don't write this way:\n\nStrawberry launches today it's Free. Open source. Guaranteed by information theory.  \n  \nThe insight: When Claude confidently misreads your stack trace and proposes the wrong root cause it's not broken. It's doing exactly what it was trained to do: compress the internet into weights, decompress on demand. When there isn't enough information to reconstruct the right answer, it fills gaps with statistically plausible but wrong content.  \n  \nThe breakthrough: We proved hallucinations occur when information budgets fall below mathematical thresholds. We can calculate exactly how many bits of evidence are needed to justify any claim, before generation happens.  \nNow it's a Claude Code MCP. One tool call: detect\\_hallucination  \n  \nWhy this is a game-changer?  \n  \nInstead of debugging Claude's mistakes for 3 hours, you catch them in 30 seconds. Instead of \"looks right to me,\" you get mathematical confidence scores. Instead of shipping vibes, you ship verified reasoning. Claude doesn't just flag its own BS, it self-corrects, runs experiments, gathers more real evidence, and only proceeds with what survives. Vibe coding with guardrails.  \n  \nReal example:  \n  \nClaude root-caused why a detector I built had low accuracy. Claude made 6 confident claims that could have led me down the wrong path for hours. I said: \"Run detect\\_hallucination on your root cause reasoning, and enrich your analysis if any claims don't verify.\"  \n  \nResults:  \nClaim 1: \u2705 Verified (99.7% confidence)  \nClaim 4: \u274c Flagged (0.3%) \u2014 \"My interpretation, not proven\"  \nClaim 5: \u274c Flagged (20%) \u2014 \"Correlation \u2260 causation\"  \nClaim 6: \u274c Flagged (0.8%) \u2014 \"Prescriptive, not factual\"  \nClaude's response: \"I cannot state interpretive conclusions as those did not pass verification.\"  \n  \nRe-analyzed. Ran causal experiments. Only stated verified facts. The updated root cause fixed my detector and the whole process finished in under 5 minutes.  \n  \nWhat it catches:  \n  \nPhantom citations, confabulated docs, evidence-independent answers  \nStack trace misreads, config errors, negation blindness, lying comments  \nCorrelation stated as causation, interpretive leaps, unverified causal chains  \nDocker port confusion, stale lock files, version misattribution  \n  \nThe era of \"trust me bro\" vibe coding is ending.  \nGitHub: [https://github.com/leochlon/pythea/tree/main/strawberry](https://github.com/leochlon/pythea/tree/main/strawberry)  \nBase Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11208](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11208)  \n(New supporting pre-print on procedural hallucinations drops next week.)\n\nMIT license. 2 minutes to install.

I'm also an entrepreneur, so there are many other tasks that are not coding. And Claude Code really blew my mind when I connected these 2 worlds, last year.\n\nI tested Opcode, among other tools, but they seemed to me more of the same. I started wanting a way to visualize Claude Code projects, sessions, changes, and after a while, I realized that the key limitation was the UX. Not everything should be managed in a Terminal.\n\nThat's why I've decided to put some energy into that, and I'm happy to present \"Atelier, for Claude Code\".\n\nIt is not another integration. It's a complete creative platform on top of Claude Code, for creative professionals. Your entire creative workflow, in one workspace.\n\nResearch, writing, image generation, and content planning \u2014 all embedded, all sharing context, and in a nice UI.\n\nI integrated with Google Gemini (for image generation with Nano Banana), so we have an Image Studio inside the tool, and also DataForSEO, to provide market data. All that, combined with more than 20 curated skills and 30+ templates.\n\nIt would be great to get feedback about that, as I'm still unsure if only power-users will like this kind of tool, and maybe \"normal users\" would prefer 1 web app with everything together (instead of bringing their own AI).\n\nYou're all more than welcome to try and give feedback: [https://getatelier.app/](https://getatelier.app/)",

This extra context is explicitly not shown to the user, enabling provenance/telemetry without changing the visible question UI.\n\n\u2022 **Bash `description` rules expanded; avoid \u201ccomplex\u201d/\u201crisk\u201d** Claude\u2019s Bash tool-call `description` is now more strictly shaped: keep standard commands brief (5\u201310 words), add context for pipes/obscure flags, and never use terms like \u201ccomplex\u201d or \u201crisk\u201d\u2014only describe the action. Examples were expanded accordingly.\n\n\u2022 **Git status: never use -uall in commit/PR flows** Claude\u2019s git workflow guidance now bans `git status -uall` when preparing commits or pull requests, noting it can cause memory issues on large repos. Status checks should use safer defaults while still enumerating repo state.\n\n\u2022 **Bash schema adds internal _simulatedSedEdit object** Claude\u2019s Bash tool schema now includes an internal `_simulatedSedEdit` payload (filePath + newContent) meant for passing precomputed sed-edit preview results. This introduces a structured channel for tooling integrations around command-driven edits.\n\n**Images - Prompt changes 1 to 4**\n\n**13 Claude Code CLI 2.1.3 changelogs:**\n\n\u2022 **Merged** slash commands and skills, simplifying the mental model with no change in behavior.\n\n\u2022 Added release channel (`stable` or `latest`) toggle to `/config`\n\n\u2022 Added detection **and** warnings for unreachable permission rules, with warnings in `/doctor` and after saving rules that include the source of each rule and actionable fix guidance.\n\n\u2022 **Fixed** plan files persisting across `/clear` commands, now ensuring a fresh plan file is used after clearing a conversation.\n\n\u2022 Fixed **false skill** duplicate detection on filesystems with large inodes (e.g., ExFAT) by using 64-bit precision for inode values.\n\n\u2022 Fixed **mismatch** between background task count in status bar and items shown in tasks dialog.\n\n\u2022 Fixed **sub-agents** using the wrong model during conversation compaction.\n\n\u2022 Fixed **web search** in sub-agents using incorrect model.\n\n\u2022 Fixed **trust dialog** acceptance when running from the home directory not enabling trust-requiring features like hooks during the session.\n\n\u2022 Improved **terminal rendering** stability by preventing uncontrolled writes from corrupting cursor state.\n\n\u2022 Improved **slash command** suggestion readability by truncating long descriptions to 2 lines.\n\n\u2022 Changed **tool hook** execution timeout from 60 seconds to 10 minutes.\n\n\u2022 [VSCode] Added clickable destination selector for permission requests, allowing you to choose where settings are saved (this project, all projects, shared with team, or session only).\n\n\ud83d\udd17: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\n\n**Full source: Claude Code log**",
