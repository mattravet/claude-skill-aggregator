    "content": "I'm a pretty experienced engineer (15+ YOE). I've been using Cursor here and there for a while and have been a paid customer since Oct 2024 ($20 plan).\n\nMy Nov invoice was on Nov 20. I started working on my own project in early Dec, so plenty of time until the next invoice (Dec 20), right? Well, ever since I started my project, my spending has gone through the roof.\n\nSee the timeline below:\n\n \\- Nov 20: regular $20 invoice, life's good\n\n \\- Dec 1: started working on my project\n\n \\- Dec 14: consumed all the limits, paid $20.04 more\n\n \\- Dec 18: consumed all the limits, paid $40 more\n\n \\- Dec 20: (repeats), paid $20 more\n\n \\- Dec 23: paid $33.03 more\n\n \\- Dec 24: paid $61.09 more\n\n \\- Dec 26: paid $32.31 (switched to Pro+)\n\n \\- Dec 30: paid $81.07 more\n\n \\- Jan 03: paid $101.40 more\n\nMy current on-demand usage is $300 out of a $400 limit (kept raising the limits).\n\nSo, what the actual fk? Yes, I mostly use Opus because other models produce garbage. From time to time, I use Composer just to get some quick fixes done, but Opus is still doing all the heavy lifting.\n\nI tried Claude Code before, but I kept having the feeling that I was losing a mental connection with my code after several sessions, so I switched back to Cursor. I'm not vibe coding. \n\nAny suggestions on how to minimize spending?",

    "content": "**Claude Code 2.1.3 flag changes:** **4 flag** and **4 prompt* changes, **13 CLI** changelog, full details below.\n\n**Added:**\n\n\u2022 tengu_scratch\n\u2022 tengu_session_index\n\n**Removed:**\n\n\u2022 persimmon_marble_flag\n\u2022 strawberry_granite_flag\n\nDiff- \ud83d\udd17: https://github.com/marckrenn/claude-code-changelog/compare/v2.1.2...v2.1.3\n\n**Claude Code 2.1.3 prompt changes(4):**\n\n\u2022 **AskUserQuestion adds optional metadata.source field** Claude can now attach optional AskUserQuestion metadata (like metadata.source=\"remember\") for analytics tracking. This extra context is explicitly not shown to the user, enabling provenance/telemetry without changing the visible question UI.\n\n\u2022 **Bash `description` rules expanded; avoid \u201ccomplex\u201d/\u201crisk\u201d** Claude\u2019s Bash tool-call `description` is now more strictly shaped: keep standard commands brief (5\u201310 words), add context for pipes/obscure flags, and never use terms like \u201ccomplex\u201d or \u201crisk\u201d\u2014only describe the action. Examples were expanded accordingly.\n\n\u2022 **Git status: never use -uall in commit/PR flows** Claude\u2019s git workflow guidance now bans `git status -uall` when preparing commits or pull requests, noting it can cause memory issues on large repos. Status checks should use safer defaults while still enumerating repo state.\n\n\u2022 **Bash schema adds internal _simulatedSedEdit object** Claude\u2019s Bash tool schema now includes an internal `_simulatedSedEdit` payload (filePath + newContent) meant for passing precomputed sed-edit preview results. This introduces a structured channel for tooling integrations around command-driven edits.\n\n**Images - Prompt changes 1 to 4**\n\n**13 Claude Code CLI 2.1.3 changelogs:**\n\n\u2022 **Merged** slash commands and skills, simplifying the mental model with no change in behavior.\n\n\u2022 Added release channel (`stable` or `latest`) toggle to `/config`\n\n\u2022 Added detection **and** warnings for unreachable permission rules, with warnings in `/doctor` and after saving rules that include the source of each rule and actionable fix guidance.\n\n\u2022 **Fixed** plan files persisting across `/clear` commands, now ensuring a fresh plan file is used after clearing a conversation.\n\n\u2022 Fixed **false skill** duplicate detection on filesystems with large inodes (e.g., ExFAT) by using 64-bit precision for inode values.\n\n\u2022 Fixed **mismatch** between background task count in status bar and items shown in tasks dialog.\n\n\u2022 Fixed **sub-agents** using the wrong model during conversation compaction.\n\n\u2022 Fixed **web search** in sub-agents using incorrect model.\n\n\u2022 Fixed **trust dialog** acceptance when running from the home directory not enabling trust-requiring features like hooks during the session.\n\n\u2022 Improved **terminal rendering** stability by preventing uncontrolled writes from corrupting cursor state.\n\n\u2022 Improved **slash command** suggestion readability by truncating long descriptions to 2 lines.\n\n\u2022 Changed **tool hook** execution timeout from 60 seconds to 10 minutes.\n\n\u2022 [VSCode] Added clickable destination selector for permission requests, allowing you to choose where settings are saved (this project, all projects, shared with team, or session only).\n\n\ud83d\udd17: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\n\n**Full source: Claude Code log**",

    "content": "If you're paying $100-200/month for Claude Max, you probably have unused token capacity. I built a tool to put those tokens to work.\n\n  I love Claude Code CLI for complex, multi-file refactoring and agentic workflows. But sometimes I just want a quick inline completion while typing\u2014and I was tired of paying $19/month for GitHub Copilot on top of my Max subscription.\n\n  So I built Sidekick for Max: a VS Code extension that gives you Copilot-style inline completions powered by your existing Claude Max subscription. No extra cost, no API keys, no separate account.\n\n  How it works:\n  - A local server calls Claude Code CLI to generate completions\n  - Uses Haiku for fast, lightweight inline suggestions (minimal token usage)\n  - Uses Opus for code transforms when you need higher quality refactoring\n  - Your Max subscription handles billing\u2014just authenticate with claude auth\n\n  Features:\n  - Inline completions as you type\n  - Code transforms: select code, press Ctrl+Shift+M, describe what you want\n\n  The token efficiency angle:\n  Most of us aren't hitting our 5-hour usage limits consistently. This puts that unused capacity to work without impacting your CLI workflows. Haiku completions are cheap and fast\u2014you can use them freely throughout the day.\n\n  Links:\n  - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CesarAndresLopez.sidekick-for-max\n  - https://github.com/cesarandreslopez/sidekick-for-claude-max\n\n  Would love feedback from other Claude Max users.

    "content": "\\[UPDATE\\] I just added the 7-day trial, as suggested\n\n\\-------  \n  \nI'm a software engineer with 20+ years of experience, leading tech teams, startups, all that, so coding is not a problem. I'm also an entrepreneur, so there are many other tasks that are not coding. And Claude Code really blew my mind when I connected these 2 worlds, last year.\n\nI tested Opcode, among other tools, but they seemed to me more of the same. I started wanting a way to visualize Claude Code projects, sessions, changes, and after a while, I realized that the key limitation was the UX. Not everything should be managed in a Terminal.\n\nThat's why I've decided to put some energy into that, and I'm happy to present \"Atelier, for Claude Code\".\n\nIt is not another integration. It's a complete creative platform on top of Claude Code, for creative professionals. Your entire creative workflow, in one workspace.\n\nResearch, writing, image generation, and content planning \u2014 all embedded, all sharing context, and in a nice UI.\n\nI integrated with Google Gemini (for image generation with Nano Banana), so we have an Image Studio inside the tool, and also DataForSEO, to provide market data. All that, combined with more than 20 curated skills and 30+ templates.\n\nIt would be great to get feedback about that, as I'm still unsure if only power-users will like this kind of tool, and maybe \"normal users\" would prefer 1 web app with everything together (instead of bringing their own AI).\n\nYou're all more than welcome to try and give feedback: [https://getatelier.app/](https://getatelier.app/)",

    "content": "I usually post on Linkedin but people mentioned there's a big community of devs who might benefit from this here so I decided to make a post just in case it helps you guys. Happy to answer any questions/ would love to hear feedback. Sorry if it reads markety, it's copied from the Linkedin post I made where you don't get much post attention if you don't write this way:\n\nStrawberry launches today it's Free. Open source. Guaranteed by information theory.  \n  \nThe insight: When Claude confidently misreads your stack trace and proposes the wrong root cause it's not broken. It's doing exactly what it was trained to do: compress the internet into weights, decompress on demand. When there isn't enough information to reconstruct the right answer, it fills gaps with statistically plausible but wrong content.  \n  \nThe breakthrough: We proved hallucinations occur when information budgets fall below mathematical thresholds. We can calculate exactly how many bits of evidence are needed to justify any claim, before generation happens.  \nNow it's a Claude Code MCP. One tool call: detect\\_hallucination  \n  \nWhy this is a game-changer?  \n  \nInstead of debugging Claude's mistakes for 3 hours, you catch them in 30 seconds. Instead of \"looks right to me,\" you get mathematical confidence scores. Instead of shipping vibes, you ship verified reasoning. Claude doesn't just flag its own BS, it self-corrects, runs experiments, gathers more real evidence, and only proceeds with what survives. Vibe coding with guardrails.  \n  \nReal example:  \n  \nClaude root-caused why a detector I built had low accuracy. Claude made 6 confident claims that could have led me down the wrong path for hours. I said: \"Run detect\\_hallucination on your root cause reasoning, and enrich your analysis if any claims don't verify.\"  \n  \nResults:  \nClaim 1: \u2705 Verified (99.7% confidence)  \nClaim 4: \u274c Flagged (0.3%) \u2014 \"My interpretation, not proven\"  \nClaim 5: \u274c Flagged (20%) \u2014 \"Correlation \u2260 causation\"  \nClaim 6: \u274c Flagged (0.8%) \u2014 \"Prescriptive, not factual\"  \nClaude's response: \"I cannot state interpretive conclusions as those did not pass verification.\"  \n  \nRe-analyzed. Ran causal experiments. Only stated verified facts. The updated root cause fixed my detector and the whole process finished in under 5 minutes.  \n  \nWhat it catches:  \n  \nPhantom citations, confabulated docs, evidence-independent answers  \nStack trace misreads, config errors, negation blindness, lying comments  \nCorrelation stated as causation, interpretive leaps, unverified causal chains  \nDocker port confusion, stale lock files, version misattribution  \n  \nThe era of \"trust me bro\" vibe coding is ending.  \nGitHub: [https://github.com/leochlon/pythea/tree/main/strawberry](https://github.com/leochlon/pythea/tree/main/strawberry)  \nBase Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11208](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11208)  \n(New supporting pre-print on procedural hallucinations drops next week.)\n\nMIT license. 2 minutes to install.

Sure seems it was! here is waht I ended up with.\n\n**Total:** \\~50,000 lines of Rust, 13 days\n\n**Tech choices:**\n\n* Rust (memory safety, performance)\n* Boa (JavaScript engine - didn't build my own)\n* wgpu (GPU rendering)\n* DirectWrite (text shaping - platform API)\n* adblock-rust (Brave's engine)\n\n**What I built from scratch with Claude:**\n\n* CSS parser and cascade engine\n* Layout engine (block, inline, flex, grid)\n* DOM implementation\n* HTTP client\n* Image decoders (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP)\n\n**What I didn't:**\n\n* JavaScript engine (used Boa)\n* GPU primitives (used wgpu)\n* Platform text rendering (used DirectWrite)\n\n**What works:**\n\n* Wikipedia (complex layout)\n* Twitter (heavy JavaScript SPA)\n* YouTube (video playback)\n* GitHub (code rendering)\n* Most modern websites\n\n**What doesn't:**\n\n* Some CSS edge cases\n* WebGL (planned)\n* Extensions (not planned)\n* Perfect standards compliance\n\n**Demo:** video @hiwavebrowser on x\n\n**Download:**  [ https://github.com/hiwavebrowser/hiwave-windows/releases ](https://github.com/hiwavebrowser/hiwave-windows/releases)   [ https://github.com/hiwavebrowser/hiwave-macos/releases ](https://github.com/hiwavebrowser/hiwave-macos/releases)\n\n**Source:**  [ https://github.com/hiwavebrowser/hiwave ](https://github.com/hiwavebrowser/hiwave)\n\nIt's alpha quality, expect bugs. But it works.\n\nEdit. Update as this was pointed out, I am not attempting to mislead here.. I should have been clearer in my post that:\n\n1. Default mode is hybrid (RustKit + WebView\n2. The \"from scratch\" claim applies to the rendering engine, not the browser chrome and the macOS renderer is currently much farther along than the windows version.\n\nedit2: heres the latest progress on the 100% rustkit renderer, getting somewhere [smoke testing](https://imgur.com/a/iZ87mR2)\n\nedit3. I've been able to improve baseline render pixel parity (compared to a regular browser) progress is slow but steady. Here is a video from [two hours ago](https://imgur.com/a/AiYe0FE).  Here is a video from [a moment ago](https://imgur.com/a/RJW95ht). I'm now working to collect these tests and compare changes against each other to see what nobs are causing what results to try and make some more careful improvements. It always ends up some 0 size field coming from somewhere else.\n\nEdit 4 1-7 Noon: Sorry I didn\u2019t realize the second video was cutoff at the bottom, it was about 40% parity match. Overnight I accomplished \\~60%! This was using my swarm testing. Im likely to burn out my cursor queue this weekend if not before. 68% right now, so I\u2019m gonna focus more on getting the Linux build up and running. My Linux laptop is having some issues recognizing its own hardware so I\u2019m going to update to the latest Ubuntu in a Hail Mary fix. I\u2019m waiting on the Amazon man to deliver a thumb drive big enough to hold the iso (it\u2019s gotten pretty large)\n\nEdit 5: Renderer reporting 88%, unsure, definite improvements and this value is an average so its possible, but still a ways to go. Will have to take a look at how we compute the values and revisit. I'd say 65% is maybe closer but the way its not linear I guess things are possible. [Video Proof](https://imgur.com/a/4nuThsP) Dont let the blurryness of the video fool you, its actually getting good. Have a headache tonight so progress is scant today.\n\nEdit 6. Final for this post. I\u2019ll make a new post Monday sometime. I just added the Linux repo a moment ago. I\u2019ve also added nightly and weekly builds for each target, they may or may not work. Will fix errors as they arise. The macOS build has made considerable progress on the renderer, 100% pixel parity (or very close to it) however pages aren\u2019t fully displaying properly, taking a new approach. I\u2019ve also added some nightly parity tests to make sure we don\u2019t break things. No videos today, I\u2019m exhausted from the week, but not giving up, still very much committed to this idea.",

    "title": "Opus 4.5 head-to-head against Codex 5.2 xhigh on a real task. Neither won.",
    "content": "I'm home alone after New Years. What do I decide to do? Force my two favorite AI coding \"friends\" to go head-to-head.\n\nI expected to find a winner. Instead, I found something more interesting: using both models together was more effective than using either individually.\n\n# The Setup\n\nThis wasn't benchmarks or \"build Minecraft from scratch.\" This was real work: adding vector search to my AI dev tooling (an MCP server I use for longer-term memory).\n\n**The rules**: SOTA models, same starting prompt, parallel terminals.\u00a0**The tools**: Anthropic $100/m subscription, ChatGPT Plus (~~$20~~\u00a0$0/m for this month -\u00a0*thanks Sam!*)\n\nBoth models got the same task across three phases:\n\n* **Research**\u00a0\\- Gather background, find relevant code\n* **Planning**\u00a0\\- Create a concrete implementation plan\n* **Review**\u00a0\\- Critique each other's plans\n\nI've used Claude pretty much daily since April. I've used Codex for three days. My workflow was built around Claude's patterns. So there's definitely a Claude bias here - but that's exactly what makes the results interesting.\n\n# The Highlights\n\n**Research phase:**\u00a0Claude recommended Voyage AI for embeddings because they're an \"Anthropic partner.\" I laughed out loud. Claude citing its creator's business partnerships as a technical justification is either endearing or concerning - especially given the flak OpenAI gets for planned ads. Turns out Anthropic may have beat them to it...\n\n**Planning phase:**\u00a0Claude produces cleaner markdown with actionable code snippets. Codex produces XML-based architecture docs. Different approaches, both reasonable.\n\n**Review phase:**\u00a0This is where it got interesting.\n\nI asked each model to critique both plans (without telling them who wrote which). Round 1 went as expected\u2014each model preferred its own plan.\n\nThen Codex dropped this:\n\n&gt;\n\nAt first look Claude's plan was reasonable to me - it looked clean, well-structured, thoroughly reasoned. It also contained bugs / contradictions.\n\nCodex found two more issues:\n\n* Claude specified both \"hard-fail on missing credentials\" AND \"graceful fallback\"\u2014contradictory\n* A tool naming collision with an existing tool\n\nWhen I showed Claude what Codex found:\n\n&gt;\n\nThe plan was better off by having a second pair of eyes.\n\n# My Takeaway\n\nThe winner isn't Codex or Claude - it's running both.\n\nFor daily coding, I've switched to Codex as my primary driver. It felt more adherent to instructions and more thorough (plus the novelty is energizing). Additionally, when compared to Codex, Claude seemed a bit... ditzy. I never noticed it when using Claude alone, but compared to Codex, the difference was noticeable.\n\nFor anything that matters (architecture decisions, complex integrations), I now run it past both models before implementing.\n\nThe $200/month question isn't \"which model is best?\" It's \"when is a second opinion worth the overhead?\" For me: any time I find myself wondering if the wool is being pulled over my eyes by a robot (which it turns out is pretty often).\n\nSorry Anthropic, you lost the daily driver slot for now (try again next month!). But Claude's still on the team.\n\n# The Receipts\n\nI documented everything. Full transcripts, the actual plans, side-by-side comparisons. If you want to see exactly what happened (or disagree with my conclusions), the raw materials are on my blog:\u00a0[https://benr.build/blog/claude-vs-codex-messy-middle](https://benr.build/blog/claude-vs-codex-messy-middle)\n\nThis is n=1. But it's a documented n=1 with receipts, which is more than most AI comparisons offer.\n\nCurious if anyone else has tried running multiple models on the same task. What patterns have you noticed?",

    "title": "I built a \"Forest of Trees\" interface for LLMs because linear chats (like ChatGPT) were getting too messy for my study sessions.",
    "content": "Hi r/ChatGPTCoding\n\nMy name is Farrell, I want to share about the tool I made to solve a frustration I have when using ChatGPT\n\n\u00a0I like using LLMs to study, and whenever I do, I have a\u00a0*lot*\u00a0of side questions.\n\n* \"Wait, what does that term mean?\"\n* \"Can you explain that specific concept?\"\n\nIn ChatGPT (*or Gemini, Claude, etc*), whenever I ask these side questions, it clutters the main thread. Often times, I even ask follow up questions TO my side questions. So I either have to scroll to where I left off, `Ctrl+F` , or start a new chat and lose all the context. ChatGPT has folders and their own branching feature, but it doesn't feel enough for me.\n\nSo I built\u00a0**Divi**. It works like a \"forest of trees\" or \"fractal\". Whenever you have a side question, you just\u00a0**Branch**\u00a0off. Branching gives you a clean chatroom, while remembering the full conversation you had earlier (from the parent branch).\n\nOnce you\u2019re satisfied with the answer, you can jump back to your original chat like nothing happened. You can branch as much as you want, even from other branches.\n\nThat's the gist of Divi, I originally intended it as a personal tool, but having heard my friends asking to try it out, I tried making it online. See if it might help improve your \"Quality of Life\" when using chatGPT. It's on: [https://trydivi.vercel.app/](https://trydivi.vercel.app/) (I'll remove the link if it violates the subreddit rules \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb)\n\nHere are more explanation on the other features I made:\n\nObviously, creating infinite branches can get confusing. To fix this, I added a\u00a0**Graph Visualization**\u00a0(inspired by Obsidian). Every branch is a node, so you can visually see your \"train of thought\" and jump between conversations just by clicking on the graph.\n\n**How \"Context\" Works in Divi:** Unlike standard chats where context is just \"the last 50 messages,\" Divi treats context like a family tree.\n\n* **Vertical Inheritance:**\u00a0When you reply to a message, the AI sees the full history of that \"Branch\" all the way back to the \"Root.\"\n* **Horizontal Isolation:**\u00a0Sibling branches are invisible to each other. If you branch off to talk about\u00a0*Topic A*, and then make a new branch for\u00a0*Topic B*, the AI in Branch B knows nothing about Branch A. This keeps your clean slate truly clean.\n\nAnd I added a few things I personally needed,\n\n**1. The Global Backpack (Topic-Specific Memory):**\u00a0This sits at the \"Root\" of your tree. Any text you put here is injected into\u00a0*every single branch*\u00a0of that specific topic.\n\n* You start a \"Cooking Research\" chat, you put \"I am allergic to peanuts\" in the Global Backpack. Now, whether you are 5 branches deep looking at Thai food or Italian food, the AI knows \"you are allergic to peanuts\".\n* This memory\u00a0stays\u00a0in the Cooking chat. If you start a new Root for \"Studying LLMs,\" the AI won't know that you \"have a peanut allergy. It isolates memory per topic.\n\n**2. The Universal Backpack:**\u00a0Since the Global Backpack\u00a0*only*\u00a0lives inside its own topic, I needed a place for instructions I want every single AI to know. You can head to\u00a0**Settings -&gt; Universal Memory**\u00a0to add instructions that apply globally across\u00a0*all*\u00a0your roots and branches. This is perfect for instructions like \"Always explain things like I'm 5,\" or \"Code in Python unless specified.\" It ensures your preferences are respected everywhere, not just in one specific chat.\n\n**3. Model Switching:**\u00a0You can switch models at any point of the conversation while retaining all the chat history.\n\nDivi free to use, but since I'm paying for the API calls out of pocket, I require Google Sign-In to prevent bot attacks and huge cloud bills.\n\n* **Free Tier:**\u00a0100k tokens/month (enough for casual use).\n* **For Testers:**\u00a0If anyone here actually finds this useful and hits the limit, just DM me or leave feedback. I\u2019d be happy to upgrade you to the 3M token tier for free in exchange for feedbacks!\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate any feedback to help improve it. Thanks!\n\nTry Divi: [https://trydivi.vercel.app/](https://trydivi.vercel.app/)\n\nP.S (I used AI a bit to help structure my words a bit since I suck and tend to overexplain things. I hope that's okay here.)",
