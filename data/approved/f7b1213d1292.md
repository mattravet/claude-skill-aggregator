I’ve been down a rabbit hole for the past week and wanted to share what came out of it.

I kept finding myself doing the same Claude Code tasks over and over. Summarize this repo. Check these work items. Post updates. I thought: why am I manually running these?

What if I could just… schedule it? Like cron, but for AI agents. So I build (or better… let Claude Code build) Claude Runner. It’s basically a scheduling server that:
	∙	Runs Claude Code CLI tasks on a schedule (cron expressions)
	∙	Triggers prompts from webhooks (so external events can kick off AI workflows)
	∙	Lets me create new MCP servers on the fly, Idescribe what I want and it writes the Python code
	∙	Tracks token usage and costs
	∙	Sends me emails with results

The nice part? I connected it as an MCP server to my Claude mobile app. So now I can literally have a conversation like “create a job that checks HackerNews every morning and emails me the top AI posts” and it just… does it.


Setup (for now) runs on an old MacBook Air sitting in a corner, lid closed, doing actual work for once.
	∙	Single Python file using FastMCP
	∙	SQLite for storage
	∙	ngrok for webhooks and remote access (including oAuth)
	∙	Claude Code CLI with the Agentic SDK doing the actual work

That’s it. No cloud bills. No Kubernetes. Just an old laptop that was collecting dust and now runs my AI automations 24/7.

Some things I’m running
	∙	Automated local news aggregation for my municipality’s Facebook page (twice daily, filters by relevance, posts automatically)
	∙	Azure DevOps webhook that triggers Claude to analyze and document any work item tagged “Claude”
	∙	Daily digest emails summarizing specific topics

Now an even more fun part is the dynamic-mcp’s. Need to integrate with a new API? Just tell Claude to create an MCP server for it. The server persists, and now all my jobs can use those tools. This is a big change compared to ChatGPT (or other platforms) tasks.

It’s like giving Claude persistent memory AND the ability to extend its own capabilities.

What surprised me
1. Claude Code’s tool use is SO much more powerful than API calls. It can chain together web searches, file operations, API calls, … actual agentic behavior.
2. The MacBook Air handles it fine. It’s not doing heavy compute, just orchestrating Claude API calls. Runs cool and quiet.

What’s next
Thinking about packaging this up for others. The architecture could scale to “central brain + worker nodes” but honestly, even as a personal tool running on forgotten hardware, it’s been a game changer.
That laptop went from “I should probably sell this” to genuinely useful.

Also thinking about giving the jobs access to create new jobs within themselves… but maybe too dangerous for now. 😅

Written with the help of Claude Code off course…
