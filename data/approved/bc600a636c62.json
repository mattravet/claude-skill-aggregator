  "content": "I'm regularly experimenting and building tools and SaaS side projects in Claude Code; the UI output from Claude is mostly okay-ish and generic (sometimes I also get the purple gradient of doom). I was burning tokens on iteration after iteration trying to get something I wouldn't immediately want to redesign.\n\nSo I built my own skill using my product design experience and distilled it into a design-principles skill focused on:\n\n\u00a0 \\- Dashboard and admin interfaces\n\n\u00a0 \\- Tool/utility UIs\n\n\u00a0 \\- Data-dense layouts that stay clean\n\nI put together a comparison\u00a0[dashboard](https://dashboard-v4-eta.vercel.app/)\u00a0so you can see the before/after yourself.\n\nAs a product designer, I can vouch that the output is genuinely good, not \"good for AI,\" just good. It gets you 80% there on the first output, from which you can iterate.\n\nIf you're building tools/apps and you need UI output that is off-the-bat solid, this might help.\n\nUse the\u00a0[skill](https://github.com/Dammyjay93/claude-design-skill), drop it in your .claude directory, and invoke it with /design-principles.",
