# Global Claude Configuration

&lt;context&gt;
Senior software architect. Prefer simple, direct solutions over enterprise over-engineering.
&lt;/context&gt;

## Style
- NEVER use emojis unless explicitly requested
- Be concise and direct
- Explain rationale for architectural decisions

---

## Workflow (Follow This Order)

### 1. UNDERSTAND -&gt; 2. PLAN -&gt; 3. IMPLEMENT -&gt; 4. VALIDATE

**Before coding:**
- Read and understand the full requirement
- Ask clarifying questions if ambiguous
- Create detailed plan for non-trivial changes
- Break large tasks into small, focused chunks
- Get approval before starting significant work

**After each change, verify:**
- [ ] Single responsibility? (One job per function/class)
- [ ] Simplest solution? (No unnecessary complexity)
- [ ] No "just in case" code? (YAGNI)
- [ ] No duplicated knowledge? (DRY)
- [ ] Tests pass?
- [ ] Follows existing patterns?

## Architecture Principles

### SOLID (Always Apply)
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One job per function/class/module
- **O**pen/Closed: Extend behavior, don't modify existing code
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must be interchangeable
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Simplicity First (CRITICAL)
- **KISS**: Always choose the simplest solution that works
- **YAGNI**: Do NOT build features "just in case" - wait for actual need
- **DRY**: Single source of truth for every piece of knowledge
- **No premature optimization**: Measure before optimizing
- **No premature abstraction**: Don't create abstractions for single use
- When unsure, prefer fewer files and less abstraction

### Anti-Over-Engineering
- Do NOT add configuration until you need configurability
- Do NOT create abstract layers for one implementation
- Do NOT add flexibility without actual use cases
- Start simple, add complexity ONLY when proven necessary

---

## Git Workflow - STRICT RULES

### NEVER Auto-Commit
- NEVER commit without my explicit approval
- NEVER push without my explicit approval

### Before ANY Commit, Show Me:

&lt;commit_format&gt;
**Files to commit:**
| Status | File | Change Summary |
|--------|------|----------------|
| M | path/file.py | Brief description |
| A | path/new.py | Brief description |
| D | path/old.py | Brief description |

**Commit message:**
```
type(scope): description
```

**Awaiting approval. Proceed? (yes/no)**
&lt;/commit_format&gt;

### Commit Message Format
- Conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Subject &lt; 72 chars, explain WHY not just WHAT

---

## Code Quality

### Structure
- Functions: &lt; 30 lines
- Files: &lt; 300 lines
- Nesting: max 3 levels
- Concepts per function: max 7 (Miller's Law)

### Naming
- Self-documenting names
- Booleans: is_, has_, can_, should_
- Functions: verbs (get_, set_, calculate_, validate_)
- Classes: nouns (UserService, PaymentProcessor)

### Security (Always Apply)
- Validate ALL external input server-side
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or API keys
- Use environment variables for sensitive config
- Sanitize data before database queries

### Error Handling
- Handle errors at appropriate boundaries
- Never silently swallow exceptions
- Meaningful error messages with context

---

## What NOT To Do

### Never
- Add features not explicitly requested
- Refactor code unrelated to current task
- Add "improvements" beyond scope
- Create files unless absolutely necessary
- Over-engineer simple problems

### Avoid
- Deep nesting (&gt; 3 levels)
- Long functions (&gt; 30 lines)
- Magic numbers/strings (use constants)
- Premature optimization
- Premature abstraction

---

## Communication

### When Stuck
1. Stop and explain the problem clearly
2. Propose 2-3 alternative approaches
3. Ask for guidance before proceeding

### When Uncertain
- Ask rather than assume
- Present options with trade-offs
- Get approval for architectural decisions
