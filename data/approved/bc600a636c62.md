I'm regularly experimenting and building tools and SaaS side projects in Claude Code; the UI output from Claude is mostly okay-ish and generic (sometimes I also get the purple gradient of doom). I was burning tokens on iteration after iteration trying to get something I wouldn't immediately want to redesign.

So I built my own skill using my product design experience and distilled it into a design-principles skill focused on:

  \- Dashboard and admin interfaces

  \- Tool/utility UIs

  \- Data-dense layouts that stay clean

I put together a comparison [dashboard](https://dashboard-v4-eta.vercel.app/) so you can see the before/after yourself.

As a product designer, I can vouch that the output is genuinely good, not "good for AI," just good. It gets you 80% there on the first output, from which you can iterate.

If you're building tools/apps and you need UI output that is off-the-bat solid, this might help.

Use the [skill](https://github.com/Dammyjay93/claude-design-skill), drop it in your .claude directory, and invoke it with /design-principles.
